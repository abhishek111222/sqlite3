# sqlite3

SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.


This is just a practice code in which I have used some basic operations which are used in sql. We dont need to install sqlite3 as it comes in-built with python.
